# Contributing to the CoVital Android App

## Branches and Pull Requests

We've started off using git-flow with `master` and `develop` branches, `master` only getting merged into for releases.

* `develop` should always pass all tests

* When branching off `develop` for a new project or feature we should create a branch called `feature/name-of-feature`

* When fixing a bug `fix/whatever-the-bug-was`

Ideally when making a PR for a bug fix there might be tests that show the bug is fixed.

## What to work on?

You should join the [Helpful Engineering](https://helpfulengineering.org/) Slack and join CoVital's channel there (`#project-covital-welcome`). You'll find a lot of resources for getting started with the project there. Please reach out to Jordi Saumell and Jason Pearson - one of us will help you get started.

If you see an issue marked with `good first issue` please comment on it and make a PR. Almost everyone currently working on the project is contributing on weekends but you can expect feedback on issues within a day or so.
