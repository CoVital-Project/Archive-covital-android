## Branches and Pull Requests

We've started off using git-flow with `master` and `develop` branches, `master` only getting merged into for releases.

* `develop` should always pass all tests

* When branching off `develop` for a new project or feature we should create a branch called `feature/name-of-feature`

* When fixing a bug `fix/whatever-the-bug-was`

Ideally when making a PR for a bug fix there might be tests that show the bug is fixed.

## What to work on?

We're discussing work in the Helpful Engineering slack channel, please reach out to Jordi in the `#project-monitoring-o2` channel there so we can coordinate.

Right now we're working on the different flows outlined in [Miro here]() and getting the app flushed out.
