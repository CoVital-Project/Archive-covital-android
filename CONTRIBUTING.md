# Contributing to the CoVital Android App

## Branches and Pull Requests

We've started off using git-flow with `master` and `develop` branches, `master` only getting merged into for releases.

* `develop` should always pass all tests

* When branching off `develop` for a new project or feature we should create a branch called `feature/name-of-feature`

* When fixing a bug `fix/whatever-the-bug-was`

Ideally when making a PR for a bug fix there might be tests that show the bug is fixed.

## What to work on?

You should join the [Helpful Engineering](https://helpfulengineering.org/) Slack and join CoVital's channel there (`#project-covital-welcome`). You'll find a lot of resources for getting started with the project there. Please reach out to Jordi Saumell and Jason Pearson - one of us will help you get started.

If you see an issue marked with [good first issue](https://github.com/CoVital-Project/covital-android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) please comment on it and make a PR. Almost everyone currently working on the project is contributing on weekends but you can expect feedback on issues within a day or so.

If you think there is a feature or piece of architecture we need, please make a Feature request first so that we know you're intending to work on it. We might already have a different plan in mind and just want to help make sure your efforts aren't wasted, but the issue gives us an opportunity to discuss your idea with you.

Documentation on the other hand - while there is an issue template for it, please just go ahead and file PRs for typos or broken links.
